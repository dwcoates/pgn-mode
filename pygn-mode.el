;;
;; Explanation
;;
;;     Pygn-mode is a major-mode for viewing and editing chess PGN files.
;;     Directly editing PGN files is interesting for programmers who are
;;     developing chess engines, or advanced players who are doing deep
;;     analysis on games.  This mode is not useful for simply playing chess.
;;
;; Bindings
;;
;;     No keys are bound by default.  Consider
;;
;;         (eval-after-load "pygn-mode"
;;           (define-key pygn-mode-map (kbd "M-f") 'pygn-mode-next-move)
;;           (define-key pygn-mode-map (kbd "M-b") 'pygn-mode-previous-move))

;; Notes
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;     GNU Emacs 25
;;
;;     Python and the python-chess library are needed for numerous features

;;
;;         https://pypi.org/project/python-chess/
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     `pygn-mode-after-change-function' should be made faster
;;
;;     Bracketed {comments} inside variations can't contain close-parenthesis
;;
;;     No support for recursive variations
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Make forward-exit and backward-exit defuns robust against %-escaped lines
;;     Make forward-exit and backward-exit defuns robust against semicolon comments
;;
;;     Extensive ert test coverage of

;;     pygn-mode-go-searchmoves which defaults to searching move under point
