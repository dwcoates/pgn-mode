;; Notes
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;     GNU Emacs 25
;;
;;     Python and the python-chess library are needed for numerous features
;;     such as SVG board images:
;;
;;         https://pypi.org/project/python-chess/
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     `pygn-mode-after-change-function' should be made faster
;;
;;     bracketed {comments} inside variations can't contain close-parenthesis
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Refactor to pass PGN text instead of position to inner functions
;;
;;     More consistent handling of position on and around moves
;;      - no partial moves
;;
;;     Special-case handling of position on result
;;
;;     Automatically restart server when it gets into a bad state
;;      - place :version <number> at the start of all requests and responses
;;
;;     pygn-mode-go-depth/pygn-mode-go-time should respect variations
;;
;;     pygn-mode-go-searchmoves which defaults to searching move under point
;;
;;     Flash current move on selection
;;
;; IDEA
;;
;;     pygn-ivy:
;;        Select games with ivy (via header contents)
;;        Select fens with ivy
;;
;;     UCI moves to pgn: UCI position command arguments to pgn and/or graphical display
;;
;;     count games in current file? Display in modeline?
;;
;;     evil text objects?
