;;; Commentary:

;; Quickstart

;;     (require 'pygn-mode)

;;     M-x pygn-mode-run-diagnostic

;; Explanation

;;     Pygn-mode is a major-mode for viewing and editing chess PGN files.
;;     Directly editing PGN files is interesting for programmers who are
;;     developing chess engines, or advanced players who are doing deep
;;     analysis on games.  This mode is not useful for simply playing chess.

;; Bindings

;;     No keys are bound by default.  Consider

;;         (eval-after-load "pygn-mode"
;;           (define-key pygn-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-n") 'pygn-mode-next-game)
;;           (define-key pygn-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-p") 'pygn-mode-previous-game)
;;           (define-key pygn-mode-map (kbd "M-f")     'pygn-mode-next-move)
;;           (define-key pygn-mode-map (kbd "M-b")     'pygn-mode-previous-move)
;;           (define-key pygn-mode-map (kbd "C-h $")   'pygn-mode-describe-annotation-at-pos))

;; Compatibility and Requirements

;;     GNU Emacs 26.1+, compiled with dynamic module support

;;     tree-sitter.el and tree-sitter-langs.el

;;     Python and the chess library are needed for numerous features such

;;     A version of the Python chess library is bundled with this package.

With a prefix argument ARG, enable mode if ARG is positive, and disable it
otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

a board representation corresponding to the point.  The displayed board
will respect variations.

In addition, if the cursor rests on an annotation symbol, the
meaning of the symbol will be displayed in the echo area."
